# SMS-Classifier-Ham-or-Spam

In recent years, Weâ€™ve all started receiving many
spam SMS every day. The cost of sending a text message has
dropped significantly in the last decade, and sending an SMS is
now free in most cases. Unfortunately, spammers have used this
to transmit millions of spam messages or unwanted commercial
advertisements (spam) every day. An effective spam detection is
a critical tool for assisting individuals in determining whether or
not an SMS is a spam. In this report, we used a combination of
word embedding technique, re-sampling, ensemble and machine
learning techniques to detect SMS spam. We built a spam
detection model using a dataset from UCI.
